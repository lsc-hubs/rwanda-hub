    "text": "Soil erosion is a major threat to sustainability and productivity with knock-on effects on the climate crisis and food security. It decreases soil fertility negatively affecting crop yields on fields, while eroded sediments from upstream clog downstream, dams, rivers and canals causing sedimentation and flooding. This is particularly true for hilly areas in Ethiopia, Kenya and Rwanda with high erosion risk. Soil erosion can be prevented and arrested through soil and water conservation (SWC) or sustainable land management (SLM) practices. Current land use and land management practices including crop cultivation as well as grazing do not sufficiently consider local potential, limitations and climate and soil erosion risks. While general information on improved land management may exist, context-based information on land resources, and climate and information on feasible SLM alternatives is not widely available or applied by land managers. ​"

Services can vary from web services (APIs), SMS services, brochures, up to on site visits.\nPredictions on distribution of environmental parameters in time and space, as well as yield predictions, are calculated using statistical, rule based, and/or machine learning models. Commonly available models are described as resources in the hub.\nIn the hub various software components are described which enable visualisation and/or analysis of relevant data and knowledge sources\nApproaches describe commonly known mechanisms to improve land management to overcome challenges such as erosion, limited fertility, salinisation, and climate change.\nThe hub describes relevant policies to the Land Soil Crop community.

It shows, for example, for the property pH, 4 maps: the 5% prediction value, the 95% prediction value, the median of predictions and the pH map.\nThe values are given for pH*10 for better visualisation. Under the data preview, the metadata of the map is given. You can add the map to the map viewer by clicking on Add to the map.\n\n\n\nmapviewer add\n\n\nYou can add as many maps to the Mapviewer as you want. For example, you add another map of Organic Carbon.\n\n\n\nmapviewer add2\n\n\nIf you now click on the compare button as described in the previous section, and put one layer to the left and the other to the right, you can compare the layers side-by-side.\n\n\n\nmapviewer compare2\n\n\nAbout data brings you back to the Explore map Data, and shows you the metadata describing the map. The description gives in addition which datasets are used to generate the maps.\n\nUpload provides the option to open a dataset from the local computer. Note that this data is not uploaded to a server, so this data is not shared with anyone else. You can also add web data from this panel to the map viewer.\n\n\n\n\nmapviewer localweb\n\n\nFor local files, you first need to select a file type. The file should have a spatial component and/or coordinates to add it to the map viewer. In step 2, you browse your file on your local computer.\n\n\n\nmapviewer local\n\n\nFor web data, you first need to select the file or web service type. In step 2, you will add the URL to add the web data. For example, you can add the ESA land cover map as a WMS layer. The URL is: https://worldcover2020.esa.int/geoserver/gwc/service/wms?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1\n\n\n\nmapviewer web\n\n\nYou can compare these maps with other added maps, through the compare button.\n\n\n\nmapviewer compare2\n\n\n\nAs soon as layers are loaded on the map, you can set the order of the layers, view a legend of the layer, zoom to its extent, set its opacity and view the metadata of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe steps of this exercise are written down under the help button. By clicking on Take the tour, it will guide you through the steps.\n\n\n\nSearch for a location to quickly find an area of interest\nUse ‘Explore map data’ to view the catalogue of available data sets and add at least two to the map\nInteract with the data layer, including opacity and toggling on and off on the left in your workbench, compare the maps by using the compare button\nClick on the data on the map to view more detailed data, including the raw data\nChange your base map using options in ‘Map Settings’ to help make some data sets more visible\nZoom and change your view, including tilting the view angle using the controls on the right-hand side of the screen\n\n\n\nDownload data as files or from web services\nData is made available in various formats by the providers of the data. Common are file downloads in Excel, Esri Shape or GeoTiff format. Some organisations provide data access via web services. Web services enable partial downloads of a dataset, filtered by attribute, temporal or spatial extent. Common web service types are:\n\nOGC:WMS visualizes spatial data in map viewers\nOGC:WFS downloads a part of a vector dataset\nOGC:WCS downloads a part of a grid dataset\n\nVarious software is available to interect with these data formats and data services. In this article we explain how you can use QGIS Desktop to interact with web services for spatial data."

You can either directly contribute via the github platform, but a feed back mechanism is also provided on each of the hub resources.\nProviding your feedback is crucial for several reasons:\n\nFirstly, incorporating diverse perspectives from stakeholders involved in working with and benefiting from land, soil, and crop information ensures that the LSC hub caters to the actual needs and demands of its users (Data providers/Users). This feedback allows for the fine-tuning of the hub’s functionalities, making it more user-friendly and effective in serving the specific requirements of different user groups.\nSecondly, gathering feedback facilitates continuous improvement. It provides an opportunity to identify potential shortcomings or areas needing enhancement within the LSC hubs. Insights from stakeholders enable the developers and administrators of the hub to address any challenges faced by users, thereby refining the system to better align with the expectations and requirements of its intended beneficiaries.\nMoreover, involving stakeholders in providing feedback fosters a sense of ownership and collaboration. When users feel heard and their inputs valued, it encourages their active participation and engagement with the LSC hub. This collaborative approach promotes a sense of ownership among stakeholders, leading to increased utilization and sustained support for the system in the long term.\nUltimately, the feedback obtained from diverse stakeholders during the workshop plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the LSC hub evolves as a valuable, user-centric platform, effectively supporting decision-making processes related to land, soil, and crop information in the agricultural landscape.\n\nEvery page or resource on the hub provides an option to provide feedback and/or ask a question related to the content. In these sections, you can provide feedback about the page and what you would like to be adjusted."
